        <p id="description">
           Do you sometimes wonder why is the weather so peculiar? Sometimes its 65 degrees during a winter day or maybe its snowing during the month of May. 
           And this is no phenomenon but the effect of Climate Change. And the main causes of this unfortunately, are us humans. From the 1800s to now, 
           there has been An increase in the earth's atmospheric and oceanic temperatures widely predicted to occur due to an increase in the greenhouse 
           effect resulting especially from pollution, which are caused by man-made creations such as factories, cars and the burning of fossil fuels. And it will 
           keep getting worse unless we do something. And with the help of you and these amazing organizations and programs that have been specifically created
           to tackle these issues, we can have a better world and a safe space to live in.
