            <p>See, here at Letters to Strangers, we believe that writing is humanity distilled into ink. And we've seen personally how one letter--one human connection--can truly save a life. If we were all a bit kinder to each other; if we listened to strangers and trusted that they would listen to us, we'd be choosing to love and believe in the universality of humanity. For mental health to matter, we need to make that choice. Without empathy, society cannot progress. That's why we write letters.</p>
