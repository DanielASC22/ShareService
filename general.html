            <p>The Snuggles Project is well-known as a multi-beneficial project. The first, and most important, benefit is to the animals. 
                After being given a Snuggle, a frightened and/or difficult to handle animal is able to become calm. 
                This calming effect gives the animal and the caregiver time to learn how to handle the situation. 
                We believe that this calming effect has saved the lives of many newly-sheltered animals</p>

            <p> We don’t just transform the “physical” environment at a shelter. What we do goes much deeper than just changing a surface.
                When we change the physical environment it changes the way women and children feel about themselves. A beautiful space sends the 
                message “you matter and you are worthy”. For the “village” that supports us, it is inspiring to share their hearts with each hand-made 
                item donated knowing it will help heal those who are rebuilding their lives. Click on any of the programs that interest you to learn 
                how you can be a part of the “village” that is changing lives.</p>
